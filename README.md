VAST Challenge 2016 â€“ Return to Kronos (Mini challenge 2)
This challenge involves analysis of a collection of static data about two weeks of GAStech operations data, including building sensor readings and prox-card movement throughout the building. Deliverables include interesting patterns, anomalies/unusual events that are most likely to represent a danger or a serious issue for building operations, and relationships between the proximity card data and building data elements.
